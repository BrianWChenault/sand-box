This is a personal project for holding a variety of things.

For AffiniPay:

Here is some code which satisfies the problem statement I was given.  Just clone this repo, run sbt then use

`run "<some_time>" <some_update>` 

and you should be good to go.  Also I will make this repo private again after you clone this down just in case you use this
problem in other interviews.
